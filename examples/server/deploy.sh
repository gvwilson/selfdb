# Deploy self-httpd to an ordinary Linux host over ssh.
#
# The host does not have to be NixOS. It needs a C compiler, libsqlite3-dev,
# python3, systemd and root, because three things have to be installed there:
#
#   /usr/local/bin/self-exec   the binfmt_misc interpreter
#   /etc/binfmt.d/self.conf    the registration that makes ./server runnable
#   /srv/self/server           the artifact: website, program and log, one file
#
# An existing deployment's `visits` and `presses` are carried over into the
# new build, because a deploy replaces the program but not the data -- and in
# this format both live in the same file.
#
# The deployment runs WAL by default: a public site should take the ~3x on
# response time, and the single-file property still holds at rest, because the
# unit stops the server with SIGTERM and every worker closes its connection.
# Pass `delete` as the third argument for one file even while serving.
#
# Usage: bash examples/server/deploy.sh [user@]host [port] [wal|delete]
